# figure-configuration-based-on-FPGA
#a course homework using Verilog
This project aimed to accomplish figure configuration on FPGA. We used Vivado 2016 as our developing tool. 

Unfortunately, we did not have enough time to fix our project, thus every thing was okey in simulation but there were something wrong when synthesizing the code on board.
What's more, in the process, we believed that Machine Learning was a better and more promising choice, which, however, may cost plenty of time for a novice.

However, we believe that this project may offer some help for students like us struggling for a FPGA project or homework for verilog.
